Example applicatin for Grails Apache Ki plugin usage.

To run this app:
Checkout entire plugin project from git repository
In the plugin directory execute: grails package-plugin
You should now have a grails-ki-X.Y[-SNAPSHOT].zip file
In the example directory execute: grails install-plugin ../plugin/grails-ki-X.Y[-SNAPSHOT].zip
The Ki plugin will install
Run the app: grails run-app

You should be presented with a URL to connect to on your localhost, open that in a browser now.

3 controllers ship with this example:
AuthOnlyController - Simply requires you to login
HasRoleController - Protected by a security filter and requires the logged in user to have the role 'Role0'
RequiresRoleContoller - Protected by the 'RequiresRoles' annotation, requires the logged in user to have the role 'role1' - currently this is not working

There are five test accounts provided user0 .. user5, user0 has Role0 assigned to it, likewise user1 and Role1 assigned.

A simple app but hopefully a useful working example for newcomers
